# Meeting on 2024-08-19
## Data Updates
- **GBIF:** plant dataset that we looked at during summit [INSDC Host Organism Database](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/393b8c26-e4e0-4dd0-a218-93fc074ebf4e)
    - scraped genetic data from NCBI, Japanese and European nucleotide archives
    - Viruses with associated host taxa information
    - Lizzie's exploration of a subset of the data: https://github.com/EMLgit/GBIF-viruses

- **NEON data:** sequencing files not well organized: download zipfiles of fasta files. But sampling is well setup for tick disease and tickborn disease in rodents.
